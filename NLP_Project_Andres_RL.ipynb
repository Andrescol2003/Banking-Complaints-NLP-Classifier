        "This project builds an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for classifying and analyzing customer complaints submitted to a major U.S. bank.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective is to automate the triage and routing of complaints by using machine learning and transformer-based models. The project also incorporates sentiment analysis to assess customer emotions and prioritize critical issues.\n",

        "Key steps included:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data cleaning and preprocessing of over 7,000 complaint records\n",
        "\n",
        "Text vectorization using TF-IDF for baseline models\n",
        "\n",
        "Training and evaluation of traditional classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a BERT transformer model to classify complaints with ~77% accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "Performing sentiment analysis using VADER to detect negative, positive, or neutral tones\n",
